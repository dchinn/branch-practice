// write a function called longestWord that accepts a string and 
// returns the longest word in the string.

// sample call

// console.log(longestWord ("the cow jumped over the moon")); // return "jumped"

// hints:
// enter the string in the console and see what it returns. you can
// also look up the String.split method on google
// > "the cow jumped over the moon".split(" ")

// the function you need to write is very similar to the one we did to
// return the maximum number in an array of numbers. 

// Re-watch that section of the class video to see how we calculated 
// the maxNum in an array of number.

// in this case you need to store the longest word you've seen so far 
// and update that value when the length of the next word in the longest
// seen so far.

function longestWord(str) {
