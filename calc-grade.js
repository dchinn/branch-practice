// write a function called calculateGrade, that takes an array of grades,
// such as [80, 86, 75, 90], and calculates the average of the grades.

// NOTE: average = sum of all of the grades/number of grades.

// after you have calculated the average, determine the letter grade 
// for that corresponds to the class average. So we want to return the average
// letter grade for the test.

// 0-59: F
// 60-69: D
// 70-79:C
// 80-89: B
// 90-100:A

// Hints: 

// You'll need to use an if/else if block to test whether the average grade is
// >= the lower number and <= the higher number in each range.

// when the function is done, comment-in the test

function calculateGrade(grades) {
  }

  //console.log(grade);
  return grade;
}
